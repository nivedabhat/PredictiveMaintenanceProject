# 🛠️ Predictive Maintenance Project

## 📌 Objective

This project aims to develop a Predictive Maintenance system that can detect potential equipment failures before they happen. This reduces downtime, saves costs, and increases operational efficiency.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Industrial machines can fail unexpectedly, leading to expensive repairs and operational loss. Using machine learning, we will predict which machines are likely to fail based on sensor data, operating conditions, and historical failures.
